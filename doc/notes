[ fixes ]

when transmitting a message using +10db, current drawn
increases up to 20mA and stay constant. no more messages
are transmit. this behavior does not appear when using
the USB FTDI power supply. I guess this is due to the
current drawn being too large for the coil (cf. specs).
To solve the issue, I added 2 capacitors (100nF, 33uF)
to provide enough current when the wireless chipset is
transmiting. also, using -10db works fine, but limits
the range.

use vertical coin holder to ease coin changing
